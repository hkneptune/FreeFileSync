	<h1>Expert Settings</h1>

	<p>
		FreeFileSync has a number of special-purpose settings that can only be accessed
		by manually opening the global configuration file <span class="file-path">GlobalSettings.xml</span>.
		Note that this file is read once when FreeFileSync starts and saved again on exit.
		Therefore, you should <b>apply manual changes only while FreeFileSync is not running.</b>
		For the portable FreeFileSync variant the file is found in the installation folder,
		for local installations go to:
	</p>
	
	<table style="border-spacing:0;">
		<tr><td>Windows:</span></td> <td><b><span class="command-line">%AppData%\FreeFileSync</span></b></td></tr>
		<tr><td>Linux:</td>          <td>&lt;installation folder&gt;</td></tr>
		<tr><td>macOS:</td>          <td><b><span class="command-line">~/Library/Application Support/FreeFileSync</span></b></td></tr>
	</table>

	</div>
	<br>

	<p>
		<b>FileTimeTolerance:</b><br>
		By default file modification times
		are allowed to have a 2 second difference while still being
		considered equal. This is required by FAT/FAT32 file systems which
		store file times only with a 2-second precision.
	</p>

	<p>
		<b>FolderAccessTimeout:</b><br>
		When testing if a particular folder path exists FreeFileSync will time out
		after the specified number of seconds if the operating system does not respond (e.g. non-reachable network share).
	</p>

	<p>
		<b>RunWithBackgroundPriority:</b><br>
		While synchronization is running, other applications that are accessing the same
		data locations may experience a noticeable slowdown. Enable this
		setting to lower FreeFileSync's resource consumption at the cost of a
		significantly slower synchronization speed.
	</p>

	<p>
		<b>LockDirectoriesDuringSync:</b><br>
		In order to prevent multiple synchronization tasks from reading and writing the same files,
		FreeFileSync instances are serialized with lock files (<span class="file-path">sync.ffs_lock</span>).
		The lock files are only recognized by FreeFileSync and make sure that at most,
		a single synchronization is running against a certain folder at a time while
		other instances are queued to wait.
		This ensures that only consistent sets of files are subject to synchronization.
		The primary use case are network synchronization scenarios where
		multiple users run FreeFileSync concurrently against a shared network folder.
	</p>

	<p>
		<b>VerifyCopiedFiles:</b><br>
		If active, FreeFileSync will binary-compare source and target files after
		copying and report verification errors. Note that this may double
		file copy times and is no guarantee that data has not already been
		corrupted prior to copying. Additionally, corruption may be hidden by
		deceptively reading valid data from various buffers in the
		application and hardware stack:<br>

		the CopyFile function verify that the data reached its final destination successfully?</a>
	</p>

	<p>
		<b>NotificationSound:</b><br>
		Select sound files from the FreeFileSync installation directory to be played after comparison or synchronization. Set empty names if no sound should be played.
