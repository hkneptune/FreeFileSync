	</h1>

	<p>
		The primary purpose of RealTimeSync is to execute a command line each time it <b>detects changes</b> in one of the monitored directories,
		or when a <b>directory becomes available</b> (e. g. insert of a USB-stick). Usually this command line will trigger a FreeFileSync batch job.<br>
		<br>

		RealTimeSync will register to receive change notifications directly from the operating system in order to avoid the overhead of
		repeatedly polling for changes.
		Each time a file or folder is created/updated/deleted in the monitored directories or their sub directories, RealTimeSync will run the command line.
		<br><br>
	</p>

	<h2>Example: <span style="font-weight:normal">Real time synchronization - in combination with FreeFileSync</span></h2>
	<p>
		Start RealTimeSync.exe located in FreeFileSync's installation directory and
		enter the folders you want to monitor. Instead of doing this manually you can import an ffs_batch
		file via <b>Menu &rarr; File &rarr; Open</b> or simply via <b>drag and drop</b>.
		RealTimeSync will not only extract all directories relevant for synchronization,
		but will also set up the command line to execute the ffs_batch file each time changes are detected.
		Now press <b>Start</b> to begin monitoring.

		<b>Note</b>
		<ul style="margin: 0">
			<li>The command should <b>not</b> <b>block</b> progress. If you call a FreeFileSync batch job,
				make sure it won't show any popup dialogs. See notes in <a href="command-line.html">Command Line Usage</a>.
				<br>&nbsp;

			<li>RealTimeSync will skip showing the main dialog and begin monitoring immediately if
				you pass an ffs_real configuration file <b>or</b> a FreeFileSync ffs_batch file as the first
				command line argument to RealTimeSync.exe. This can be used to integrate RealTimeSync into the operating system's auto start:<br>
				<div class="command-line">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;C:\Program Files\FreeFileSync\RealTimeSync.exe&quot; &quot;D:\Backup Projects.ffs_real&quot;</div>
				<div class="command-line">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;C:\Program Files\FreeFileSync\RealTimeSync.exe&quot; &quot;D:\Backup Projects.ffs_batch&quot;</div>
				<br>

			<li>RealTimeSync is not required to start FreeFileSync. It can also be used in other scenarios, like sending an email whenever a certain directory is modified.
		</ul>
	</div>
	<br>

	<h2>Example: <span style="font-weight:normal">Automatic synchronization when a USB stick is inserted</span></h2>
	<p>
		Save an ffs_batch configuration in the USB stick's root directory,
		e.g. <span class="file-path">H:\</span> and let FreeFileSync run it when the stick is mounted.
		But, instead of hard coding the USB drive letter <span class="file-path">H:\</span> (which may change occasionally),
		refer to the USB stick via its <a href="variable-drive-letters.html">volume name</a> instead.<br>
		<br>
		Configure RealTimeSync as follows:<br>
	</p>
	<div style="display:inline-block; margin-left: 1.3cm; text-align: center;">
		<img src="../images/realtimesync-monitor-usb.png" alt="Monitor USB stick insert"><br>

		<i>"Backup" is the volume name of the USB stick in our example.</i>
	</div>

	<p>
		Whenever directory <span class="file-path">H:\Data</span> becomes available, RealTimeSync executes the command line which starts the batch job located
		on the stick. RealTimeSync will also trigger each time files are modified in <span class="file-path">H:\Data</span>.
	</p>

	<div class="bluebox">
		<b>Note</b><br>
		The full path of the last changed file and the action that triggered the
		change notification (create, update or delete) are written
		to the environment variables <b><span class="command-line">%change_path%</span></b> and <b><span class="command-line">%change_action%</span></b>.
	</div>
	<br>

	<h2>Example: <span style="font-weight:normal">Log names of changed files and directories (Windows)</span></h2>
	<p>
		<div class="greybox">
			Show which file or directory has triggered a change. Enter command line:<br>
			<div class="command-line">
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cmd /c echo %change_action% &quot;%change_path%&quot; &amp; pause
			</div>
			<br>

			Write a list of all changes to a log file:<br>
			<div class="command-line">
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cmd /c echo %change_action% &quot;%change_path%&quot; &gt;&gt; %csidl_Desktop%\log.txt
			</div>
		</div>
	</p>

	<div class="bluebox">
		<b>Note</b><br>
		When RealTimeSync executes a Windows batch file (bat or cmd) a black console window is shown. You can hide it using the Visual Basic script
		<span class="file-path">HideConsole.vbs</span> located in FreeFileSync's installation directory:
		<br><br>
		<div class="command-line">wscript &quot;C:\Program files\FreeFileSync\HideConsole.vbs&quot; C:\MyBatchFile.cmd</div>
	</div>
	<br>

	<h2>Limitations:</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>If multiple changes happen at the same time, only the path of the first file is written to variable <b><span class="command-line">%changed_file%</span></b>.
		<li>While RealTimeSync is executing the command line, monitoring for changed files is deliberately inactive.
	</ul>
	<p>
		The command line usually starts a synchronization task using FreeFileSync which naturally leads to additional file change notifications.
		Therefore, the RealTimeSync change detection has to be deactivated to not go into an endless loop.
		On the other hand, it is not likely that changes (other than those from FreeFileSync) happen in first place since RealTimeSync runs the command line only after the user-specified idle time has passed.
		This makes sure the monitored folders are not in heavy use. In any case, files changed during the execution of FreeFileSync will be synchronized the next time FreeFileSync runs.
